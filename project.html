                    <h5>Catapult 2025 @ Purdue</h5>
                    <p>In this Hackathon, which took place over the course of 24 hours at Purdue University. I took part in developing the Voices Unheard project. This project fine-tuned a pipeline for transcribing and then translating AAVE for use in courtroom settings. The goal of the project was to tackle inequality within the United State's legal system, especially for African American citizens. The Devpost for this project can be found <a href="https://devpost.com/software/let-us-speak" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <h4>LLM-Based Knowledge Graph Verbalisation</h4>
                    <h5>To be submitted ACL 2025</h5>
                    <p>In this paper, various prompting techniques are tested using the SotA LLaMa models to perform text generation directly into both English and Russian. The optimal approach to such generation includes a combination of RAG with property-overlap few-shots and a inplace Chain of Thought. The performance are then measured using various seen and unseen test sets for the target languages. In conclusion, the approach highlights significant improvements in multilingual text generation quality, demonstrating the potential for more effective and accurate Data-to-Text generation across diverse languages, specifically in English and Russian.</p>

                    <h5>To be submitted ACL 2025</h5>
                    <p>In this work, we compare three different approaches for multilingual generation from knowledge graphs into six diverse languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish): Generate into English and Machine Translating, Fine-tuning Machine Translation models, and Prompt Engineering using open source LLMs. Additionally, we put out a diverse Machine Translated training set and a curated humanly evaluated Test Set on all six languages.</p>

                    <h4>Finnish-Inari Cognate Prediction</h4>
                    <p>The project develops a deep learning model to predict cognates for endangered languages, initially trained on Spanish-French cognates and later on Finnish-Inari cognates. It aims to assist in the reconstruction of vocabulary for languages with limited resources, using an attention mechanism to enhance performance and explainability.</p>

                    <h4>Next-Word and Variant Prediction for Sardinian Dialects</h4>
                    <p>This project introduces a next-word prediction algorithm specifically designed for the four main dialects of the Sardinian language, utilizing a corpus derived from Sardinian texts on Wikipedia, which was processed to include variant tagging. The algorithm, based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, aims to enhance linguistic technology for under-resourced languages by adapting to the context and dialect variant, showing that computational models can still be valuable for languages with limited data.</p>

                    <h4>Russian Preposition Use with Social Media Names</h4>
                    <p>This study examines the variation in preposition usage before social media names (SMNs) in Russian, comparing the use between Latin and Cyrillic orthographies within a subset of the Russian National Media corpus. It was discovered that different SMNs exhibited varied levels of preposition usage inconsistency across orthographies, which was not directly linked to the prevalence of these SMNs in Russia, challenging assumptions about the influence of script on language structure in digital communication contexts.</p>

                    <h4>Next-Word Prediction Algorithm for Chukchi</h4>
                    <p>This paper presents a bi-gram text prediction system developed for the Chukchi language, as part of a global classroom project with students from Indiana University, Bloomington, and the Higher School of Economics, Moscow. The system, tailored to the polysynthetic nature of Chukchi, focuses on morpheme-level analysis instead of traditional word-level, improving prediction accuracy by considering the linguistic structure unique to Chukchi. The project highlights the challenges and adaptations necessary to address while developing predictive text technologies for such low-resource languages.</p>

                    <h4>Effects of Gender-Exclusive Language on Felt Ostracism</h4>
                    <p>This study investigates the effects of gender-exclusive language (GEL) on need satisfaction (NS) and feelings of ostracism, revealing that women may experience marginally lower NS and increased feelings of ostracism compared to men in scenarios featuring GEL. Conducted through a survey with two distinct conditions—one using GEL and the other employing gender-inclusive language — this research highlights how subtle linguistic choices can influence individual perceptions and emotional responses, irrespective of the explicit content of the dialogue. The findings suggest a nuanced interaction between language use and gender, emphasizing the importance of considering linguistic inclusivity in communication practices.</p>

                    <p>Paper Manager is a software is made to store and access papers for use by students and academics. It is built using the Tauri framework with a vanilla frontend using HTML and JS and Rust as the backend, leading to blazing fast performance. The current versions have many useful features such as easy citing, tagging, filtering, and much more. The version will be officially released to the public in the coming weeks.</p>
