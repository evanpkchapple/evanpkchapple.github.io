                    <h4>Finnish-Inari Cognate Prediction</h4>
                    <p>The project develops a deep learning model to predict cognates for endangered languages, initially trained on Spanish-French cognates and later on Finnish-Inari cognates. It aims to assist in the reconstruction of vocabulary for languages with limited resources, using an attention mechanism to enhance performance and explainability.</p>

                    <p>This project introduces a next-word prediction algorithm specifically designed for the four main dialects of the Sardinian language, utilizing a corpus derived from Sardinian texts on Wikipedia, which was processed to include variant tagging. The algorithm, based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, aims to enhance linguistic technology for under-resourced languages by adapting to the context and dialect variant, showing that computational models can still be valuable for languages with limited data.</p>

                    <h4>Russian Preposition Use with Social Media Names</h4>
                    <p>This study examines the variation in preposition usage before social media names (SMNs) in Russian, comparing the use between Latin and Cyrillic orthographies within a subset of the Russian National Media corpus. It was discovered that different SMNs exhibited varied levels of preposition usage inconsistency across orthographies, which was not directly linked to the prevalence of these SMNs in Russia, challenging assumptions about the influence of script on language structure in digital communication contexts.</p>

                    <h4>Next-Word Prediction Algorithm for Chukchi</h4>
                    <p>This paper presents a bi-gram text prediction system developed for the Chukchi language, as part of a global classroom project with students from Indiana University, Bloomington, and the Higher School of Economics, Moscow. The system, tailored to the polysynthetic nature of Chukchi, focuses on morpheme-level analysis instead of traditional word-level, improving prediction accuracy by considering the linguistic structure unique to Chukchi. The project highlights the challenges and adaptations necessary to address while developing predictive text technologies for such low-resource languages.</p>

                    <h4>Effects of Gender-Exclusive Language on Felt Ostracism</h4>
                    <p>This study investigates the effects of gender-exclusive language (GEL) on need satisfaction (NS) and feelings of ostracism, revealing that women may experience marginally lower NS and increased feelings of ostracism compared to men in scenarios featuring GEL. Conducted through a survey with two distinct conditions—one using GEL and the other employing gender-inclusive language — this research highlights how subtle linguistic choices can influence individual perceptions and emotional responses, irrespective of the explicit content of the dialogue. The findings suggest a nuanced interaction between language use and gender, emphasizing the importance of considering linguistic inclusivity in communication practices.</p>

                    <p>I worked with data collected in the field in order to create and verify thousands of lexicographic entries. Additionally, I was charged with transcribing and cleaning audios along with mapping morphological relationships between words.

The process involved focusing on areas of the vocabulary in which records were lacking and prompting the elders for utterances of each word which were then transcribed.</p>
